# Experimental Results

Please find preprint version [here](Preprint_ODRS_Paper.pdf)

The directory `20_executions` contains **TWENTY**-executions recharging summary using GA, BH and SA. Those results are used to compare performances of 3 algorithms.

The directory `odp_one_results` contains **ONE**-execution results using GA, BH and SA. The summary information can be checked in [summary file of single execution](odp_one_results/one_summary.xlsx).

The directory `odv_avg_results` contains **THREE**-executions results using GA, BH and SA. The averaged summary information can be checked in [summary file of 3 executions](odv_avg_results/avg_summary.xlsx).

The directory `VisualResult` contains the visualization of results, including experimental results of complete flight paths under 9 scenarios (as stated in the report).
